# Data Science Internship Tasks - The Sparks Foundation


This repository contains the tasks completed during my Data Science Internship with The Sparks Foundation as part of their Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP). Each task demonstrates various aspects of data science, machine learning, and analytics.

## Task 1: Linear Regression for Student Performance Prediction

Implement a linear regression model to predict student scores based on study hours.
Use Python and relevant libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib).
Visualize the relationship between study hours and scores.
Predict the score for a student studying 9.25 hours/day.
